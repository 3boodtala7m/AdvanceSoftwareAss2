i put screenshoot for class digram -IN-> src file .
This code in general expresses the nature of the company, including its employees, and what is the authority of each of them individually, such as Staff, Manager, and Director.
the most important features of the way this code is written :
1 -> Inheritance "IS - A": This relationship indicates that a subclass is a type of its superclass : subclasses Staff, Manager, Director that inherit from the common superclass Employee.
2 -> Encapsulation : The classes encapsulate their attributes and behaviors by using private fields employeeId, employeeName, hourlyRate and providing public getter and setter methods to access and modify these attributes
3 -> Polymorphism : Polymorphism is demonstrated through method overriding , calculateBudget method
4 -> Composition : The Director and Manager classes contain a list of subordinates , team members
And more features, but these are the most important
